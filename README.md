# Quick Marketplace 3.0

This package is a complete MVP codebase for Quick Marketplace:
- Customer account creation/login
- Product search and categories
- Cart and checkout
- Customer order history
- Shop-owner shop creation with required commission
- Product creation with stock/minimum order
- Delivery page with quick/local and Nigeria-wide delivery concepts
- Supabase database schema and RLS
- Admin login/settings
- Render-ready Node/Express server

## Deploy
1. Upload the repository contents to GitHub.
2. On Render use:
   Build command: `npm install`
   Start command: `npm start`
3. Add Render environment variables:
   `SUPABASE_URL`
   `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
4. Run `sql/schema.sql` once in Supabase SQL Editor.
5. Create the admin user in Supabase Auth and insert its UUID into `admin_users`.

The publishable/anon key is safe for browser use when RLS policies are correctly configured. Never put a Supabase service-role/secret key in frontend code.

Important: this is a functional MVP. Payment gateway, real delivery-worker tracking, route pricing engine, and automated commission settlement require additional backend/payment integrations before production use.
